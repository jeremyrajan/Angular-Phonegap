{"name":"Angular-phonegap","tagline":"A combination of Angular & Phonegap with Yeoman","body":"<h1>Angular + Phonegap Framework with Yeoman (A<=>Y<=>P) </h1>\r\n\r\nAYP is designed to create and build Mobile Apps using AngularJS with the help of Yeoman.\r\n\r\n<h3>What?</h3>\r\n\r\nAYP provides a basic angular seed app in AngularJS wrapped around Phonegap, solely for Mobile app development.\r\n\r\n<h3>Why?</h3>\r\n\r\nI have been looking for generators on Yeoman.com for phonegap+Angular but was never able to find \r\na one which worked well for me (other than that they are really good :) ). So, I found a 1 step solution\r\nto develop and build ANGULAR+PHONEGAP using YEOMAN without using generators. \r\n\r\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\nMake sure you have following installed\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://nodejs.org\">NODE & NPM</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://phonegap.com\">Phonegap</a>\r\n\t<pre>sudo npm install -g phonegap</pre>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://bower.io\">Bower</a>\r\n\t<pre>npm install -g bower</pre>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://yeoman.io\">Yeoman</a>\r\n\t<pre>npm install -g yo</pre>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Install Yeoman angular generator, using <pre>npm install -g generator-angular</pre></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.figlet.org\">Figlet (optional)</li> Tip: If you have installed Brew, use \"brew install figlet\"\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>How?</h3>\r\n\r\nUsing AYP is dead simple! Clone the repo to the folder you about to use for development. Run, \r\n\t\r\n\tgit clone https://github.com/jeremyrajan/Angular-Phonegap.git .\r\n\r\n\tsh init.sh\r\n\r\n=> This will create phonegap with angular seed app using Yeoman\r\n\r\n<b>You can delete init.sh, after you have initialised the app (if needed).</b>\r\n\r\nFor building the app to \"www\" with \"phonegap\". Run,\r\n\r\n\tsh build.sh\r\n\r\n=> This will build the app to 'www' directory with minifications and optimisations necessary.\r\n\r\nThat's it! You are ready to deploy...\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if any clarifications, at jeremyrajan[at]gmail.com \r\n<br/>\r\nContributions and suggestions are always welcome...","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
